## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of various AI algorithms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide to AI techniques, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and validation
- Examples and use cases for different AI techniques

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farhanjutt23/AI-python_5.git
cd AI-python_5
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each script in this repository demonstrates a different AI technique. To run a specific script, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the script using Python. For example:

```bash
cd examples
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the script you want to run. Refer to the comments within each script for more details on its functionality and usage.
